# Scala

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
***********************

The Scala Programming language:- 
*******************************

* "Scala is an acronym for SCA-lable LA-nguage" (SCALA).
* Scala is a  modern multi - paradigm programming language designed to express common programming patterns in a concise, elegant and 
type-safe way.
* Scala is written by Martin Odersky at EPFL.

Features:-
********

* Statically typed - Variable has a type and it can hold values only of that type. Hence, Type error is caught at compile time only,
not on run-time.
* Scala uses type interfacing, i.e. it figures out the type, So we don't have to mention it expicitly.
* Scala runs on JVM and it is fully inter-operable with Java.
* Object Oriented
* Functional 
* Dynamic features
* Scala blends object-oriented and functional programming in a statically typed language.
* As fast as Java programs, and has an edge for the shorter length of code.
* Write less and Achieve more.
* Scala has fewer errors like no null pointer exception issue in Scala.
* More flexible, Can write multiple classes in a single file.

Why Scala ?
*********

Scala is Practical.

* It can be used as a replacement for Java.
* Mixed Scala/Java projects.
* Can use already existing Java libraries.
* Can use existing Java tools (Ant, Maven, JUnit, etc.)
* Can use SBT which is used for writting Scala Application
* Decent IDE support (IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans)


2. SBT

What is SBT ?

* sbt (Scala Build Tool, formerly Simple Build Tool) is an open source build tool for Scala and Java projects, similar to Java's 
Maven and Ant.
* SBT is a modern build tool. While it is written in Scala and provides many Scala conveneiences, it is a general purpose build tool.
* sbt is the de facto build tool in the Scala.

Why SBT ?

* Native support for compiling Scala code.
* Uses Apache Ivy for dependency management
* Only-update-on-request model
* Full Scala language support for creating tasks
* Support for mixed Java/Scala projects
* Launch REPL(Read-Eval-Print-Loop) in project context.
